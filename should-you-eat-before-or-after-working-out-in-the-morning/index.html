8 things you should eat before and after training From mz-store.com
Fasting workouts make your body use its fat reserves for energy, meaning you will burn more fat. For most people who want to start working out in the morning, the goal is normally going to be fat burning and weight loss. Presently, it�s an ideal opportunity to reestablish that energy supply, says patton. If your energy level is high and your body feels ready, working out first thing in the morning might be the best time for you to get moving.
