The idea that you need to constantly change up your exercises, rep ranges and workout structure in order to “shock” or “confuse” your muscles into new growth is a fairly common piece of bodybuilding advice you’ll hear. Four sessions is all it takes to start seeing results and feeling the shocking effects. Do not take this set to exhaustion, however. Double stimulation training is a unique way to shock your muscles for growth.
