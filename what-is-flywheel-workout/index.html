As a beginner, you may find it challenging to select the best flywheel weight for your spin bike. In flywheel or isoinertial training, choosing inertia means more than deciding between light and heavy. The rider begins pedalling and the flywheel starts spinning. It is responsible for providing resistance to the pedals.
