One recent study found that female olympic lifters had higher bmd levels than recreationally active women and other athletes, including soccer players and powerlifters. Estradiol is about 7% lower in women who exercise than those who don’t. Exercise normalizes estrogen in perimenopause and menopausal women (if it’s done at the right dose). Estradiol is about 7% lower in women who exercise than those who don’t.
