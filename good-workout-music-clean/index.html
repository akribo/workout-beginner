The roots are known more for slick instrumental improvising at their shows than for making people bounce, but they have quite a few songs that could amp up a workout. I try to update my gym playlist every 2 weeks or so, which means i have collected a lot of fabulous upbeat workout songs over the years, and since i know i’m not the only one trying to step up my workout routine in an effort to lose weight and get toned in time for bikini season, i decided to share this list of 40 good songs to workout to. The snappy beats inspire — especially up huge hills or in the last five minutes of a workout. Pump up songs can be used in a variety of ways from making the most out of a workout to getting ready for a big day at work to helping you feel better after a lousy time and so much more.
