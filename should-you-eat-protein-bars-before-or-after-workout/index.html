Mike O�Hearn what you should eat before and after workout From youtube.com
If you need quick fuel pre workout, then eat a bar then. Eat the right amount of protein over the course of the day, and chances are you will absorb most of it properly. The best time to eat protein bars or shakes is likely before or after workouts, especially if you�re hoping to boost your protein intake and gain muscle mass. Another good reason to take a protein shake before a workout could be that you train early in the morning, or rush off during your lunch break and simply don’t have time to eat before training.
