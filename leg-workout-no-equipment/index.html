No Equipment Leg Workout Movara Fitness Resort From movara.com
I posted this leg workout in my video blogs that require no equipment. Abs, glutes, hamstrings, and quads. Continue this pulse action, inhaling for two pulses and exhaling for two pulses. Sit into your deepest squat and then let yourself fall (with precise control) forward onto your hands, so you’re roughly in a plank position but with your legs curled underneath you.
