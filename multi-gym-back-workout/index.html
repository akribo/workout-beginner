Powertrain Multi Station Home Gym with 165lb Weights and From pinterest.com
The weight stack is the core component of a multi gym, connecting every gym feature together and allowing you to perform chest presses, seated rows, lat pulldowns, leg curls, shoulder presses and more. For example, you might want to focus on the chest and shoulders on one day, arms on the next day, and legs on the final day. It�s the perfect choice for a beginner, enabling you to complete a series of different exercises that target different parts of the body. Use a much lower weight than standard bench press exercises.
