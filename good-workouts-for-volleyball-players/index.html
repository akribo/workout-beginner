The triangle volleyball drill is one of the best and easiest beginner volleyball drills. A simple twist on the traditional bench press, the inverted row provides volleyball players with a pulling exercise to balance out the more common pushing exercises in most workouts.

Plyometric exercises for volleyball are also known as jump training.
