Obviously everyone is different, seeing at the different responses here. But i guess i am pretty sensitive to it and usually for me, i�ll be tired all evening and when my head hits the pillow, i�ll be wide awake. If you like solid food better than a shake, eat this meal two hours before you train. The absence of rest can even mean more muscle fat and ruin the entire purpose.
