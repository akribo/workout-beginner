Place your hands flat on the ground by your side and lift your pelvis, bringing your knees up toward your face, then back down again. Squats train just about every muscle in your core (and lower body). Lift head and neck off the floor, looking up to ceiling, and press right arm up, lifting head and right shoulder blade off the floor. Once you move through each one of these 5 exercises, it is considered as one round finished.
