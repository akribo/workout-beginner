Whey is the fastest protein i know of, so i would include it in whatever nutrition you have before your morning workout. IÔøΩd opt for a combination of proteins so you not only break your fast properly and reverse the catabolism, but also to provide a steady stream of aminos for several hours after your workout while you need them for recovery. What should you eat before training at the crack of dawn? If you‚Äôre heading out for a longer workout, you need enough fuel to sustain you.
