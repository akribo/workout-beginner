My Focus T25 Results Fit and Sticky From fitandsticky.blogspot.com
If you focus your intensity for 25 minutes, and you do it 5 days a week, you will get results. I’m going to do my weekly focus t25 review slightly different than bbl. Why does t25 get such results? * get an hour’s results in just 25 minutes a day with focus t25 alpha &amp; beta * major studies have shown that 30 minutes of exercise can be just as effective at burning fat and even more efficient than 60 minutes of exercise * with focus t25, you need to work out just 25 minutes a day to get in the best shape of your life
