Nutrex HemoRage Black (30 Servings) From dolphinfitness.co.uk
The drink itself is somewhat thick which seemed to be slightly filling after the workout also. Mind blowing pumps and vascularity* increased strength and endurance* maximum muscle growth* extreme energy, intensity and mental focus* faster recovery* dark rage introduces a new pump inducing technology that goes far beyond nitric oxide. Dark rage works very well in terms of getting my energy levels up for the workout and allowing me to go much heavier than when i do not take anything. It is amazing in the gym while you are working out, amazing pumps.
