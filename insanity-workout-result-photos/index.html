Insanity’s workouts are 30 minutes in insanity max, and in the original go up to an hour. Next program for me is rev abs! As you may or not know, my boyfriend and i decided to try out insanity max:30 to be able to talk about the workouts to others who might be interested in the program. She entered her results into the the beachbody challenge, and won $1,500!
