Workout Anytime Vs Fitness Martial Arts Workout From martial-artsworkout.blogspot.com
Planet fitness has two membership options: Anytime fitness membership is almost $40 a month, i pay $10 a month at planet fitness. However, you can usually find a squat rack and lifting platform at anytime fitness as well as dumbbells heavier than 50lbs. I�m also wondering if i should try to get a trainer.
