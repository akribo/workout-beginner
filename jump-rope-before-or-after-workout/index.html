JUMP ROPE CHALLENGE 7 Day (1000 Jumps Per Day) Real From youtube.com
It is a basic jump except the rope has to cross under you twice before you feet hit the ground. I use the jump rope to keep my heart rate up during weightlifting, in between sets or whenever i feel like it i will jump rope. Despite the benefits that jumping rope after you workout can provide, it is, by narrow margin, better for sports specific athletes to jump rope before they workout. Both sides of the issue can be argued, but there is a general rule to follow pertaining to the wait time between eating and jumping rope.
