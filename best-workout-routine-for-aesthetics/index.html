Now, we move on to the lower body workouts. Stick to 1 min rest between sets. When you�ve outlived the usefulness of full body routines (you�ll know as size gains will stop coming) then move to an upper/lower split routine, 4 workouts a week, 3 sets of 8 reps for the first workout and 3 sets of 12 reps for the second workout. This is essentially a workout dedicated to the deltoids and lats which will really widen out your physique.
