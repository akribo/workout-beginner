ARM WRESTLING TRAINING AT HOME VIDEO 15 YouTube From youtube.com
Do it 3 times in a row, 5 times…your goal should be to sprint a match as hard at the finish as you do at the beginning. By adding these movements to your fitness routine you can begin to develop the balance, explosiveness and endurance that wrestlers are known for while at the same time improving your reaction and ability to perform or defend against grappling techniques. This is a 2 minute interval sprint routine for building match endurance. I went to their youtube channel and he had some exercises that will definitely build strength.
