HIIT Ultimate Conditioning From ultimateconditioning.ie

A complete interval training program usually comprises several short, alternating periods of both higher and lower intensity exercises. But remember that you don�t necessarily need to stick to interval training all the time. Like 30 second sprint then 2 minutes of brisk walking.
