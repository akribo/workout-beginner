How To Do The Inverted Row Exercise Men�s Fit Club From mensfitclub.com
A variation of this exercise is to do it with an underhand grip, which could increase the involvement of your arm flexors. That said, it may also add some volume to the biceps and forearms as well. The inverted row is a bodyweight resistance training exercise where you row your body against gravity. You can make the exercise heavier by placing your feet on an elevation, or easier by raising the bar to a higher rack position.
