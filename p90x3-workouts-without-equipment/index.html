Day 47 P90X3 Challenge Incinerator From pledgetostayfit.com
I use 5, 8, 10, 12 and 15 lb. Variably sized dumbbells, or resistance bands; As you can imagine, this is a very intense program and i’d personally recommend trying out the classic or lean schedules before you attempt doubles. There are two breaks in the workout for some water and you will want to make the most of them.
