What to Eat Before and After Your Workout A Healthy Life From ahealthylifeforme.com
If you think i will show you a steroid that will build your body overnight then you are wrong. Eat slow digesting carbs from oats, veggies, quinoa, brown rice, and sweet potatoes. The best option is a protein shake (whey protein) combined with carbs that are easy to digest (dextrose, glucose). Carrot, celery, and broccoli are very healthy, but they won’t help you much to restore energy and keep a healthy metabolic rhythm.
