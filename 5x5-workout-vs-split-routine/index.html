5x5 Workout Routine Spreadsheet From workoutprogramplan.blogspot.com
Madcow’s 5×5 is a workout program that increases total body strength and begins with 4 sets of 5 reps with weight that gradually increases until the final heavy, 5th set. Another similarity between them is that they are both made up of basic, compound movements and focus on strength development. Due to the intensity of the workout one exercise per body part would be sufficient, in my workout plan below i have added some optional exercises too for those that can;t help themselves. You may perform the exercises as straight sets (complete all sets for one lift before moving on to the next) or alternate sets of the two 5×5 exercises (in workouts a and b).
