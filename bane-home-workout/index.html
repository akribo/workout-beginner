The trapezius muscle sits right about your thick rhomboids muscle in your upper back, and technically there is a “lower traps” and “upper traps” area which you will find exercises for both below. Cardio is the unlikely key to building muscle this insane.

The focus here is on getting huge biceps, traps, back, and upper body.
