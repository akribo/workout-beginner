Why Your Next Workout Should be in a Bathing Suit Pool From pinterest.com.au
For a 50 meter pool, there will be some changes. Before beginning this workout, first determine the highest average pace per 100 you can hold for a set of three repeats of 300, with only 30 second rest between each swim (3 x 300 with 30 second ri). That counts for about 5mins of your weekly hiit in the pool. To begin this program, you must be able to swim 750m, bike 45km and run 9km.
