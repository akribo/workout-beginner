Beginner’s 5K training plan FITNESS AND NUTRITION From beautysecretsbyanna.wordpress.com
I had a short term goal at the time to break 6 in the mile, 14 minutes for the two mile, and then break 21 minutes for the three mile. Felt fine but was getting kind of dizzy. This plan is for beginner runners who would like to train for a marathon. Each weekend, the long run gets longer, peaking at 20 miles three weeks before the marathon.
