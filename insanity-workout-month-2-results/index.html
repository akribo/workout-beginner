<p>Month 2 Insanity workout, Plyo, Months That means insanity is a pretty far cry from your everyday workout routine. A lot of month 2 intervals recruits your entire body. It took 10 weeks and a day, but it is finished! Soreness goes away, cardio improves, confidence grows. Men also care about being fit and healthy.</p>

Month 2 workouts seemed more resistance oriented than the month 1 workouts.</p>
