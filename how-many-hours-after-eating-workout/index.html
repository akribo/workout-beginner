What to Eat Before and After Your Workouts IgHive Post From pinterest.com
If it’s something small, like around 200 calories, you could probably exercise right after eating. Proper fueling at this time will help you feel satiated during your workout, keep the stomach cramps at bay (if you choose the right food!) and give you energy for your workout. If it’s been more than 3 hours since your last big meal, you’ll want to have a snack about an hour before you work out. You may only have to wait one to three hours to exercise after a smaller meal.
