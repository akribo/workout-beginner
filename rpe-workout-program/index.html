Rate of Perceived Exertion How to Determine Running Pace From leagendersfitness.com
Pay attention because if you don’t get this right, the entire system can be thrown off to a degree. Rpe—or the rate of perceived exertion—is a scale used to identify the intensity of your exercise based on how hard you feel (or perceive) your effort to be. Week 4 — 3 sets at rpe 8. Pay attention because if you don’t get this right, the entire system can be thrown off to a degree.

Rpe allows you to train to a specific intensity to meet the goals of a particular workout. It is designed to be started 10 weeks out from a competition or a max testing.</p>

<p>PROACTIVE TRAINING PROGRAM and RPE in tennis Play Smart Rpe—or the rate of perceived exertion—is a scale used to identify the intensity of your exercise based on how hard you feel (or perceive) your effort to be. Rpe is how hard something feels to you at the time. Very light to light effort. Here is the most basic way of implementing rpe. You can also adjust your training intensity.</p>

The rpe scale typically runs from 0 to 10, with zero being literally nothing and 10 being the hardest you could possibly exert yourself.
