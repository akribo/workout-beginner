MyProtein MYPRE Review Does it live up the hype? Is the.</h3><p>Myprotein pre workout review : Myprotein was the very first supplement company i purchased from when i began getting into fitness. Probably because it was cheaper. I tried the watermelon flavor. Taste is a bit strong but ok and can tend to be a bit grainy. Good energy and performance but you can definitely get better</p>
<p>Good buzz and energy from it but flavour is absolutely disgusting, even for a pre workout, little green bits floating around in it after mixing, horrible aftertaste. I am not a big pre workout guy but jp nutrition looks one of the best. This is the second pre i have ever tried and i can’t say i’m disappointed. <em>MyProtein MYPRE Review Does it live up the hype?
