No, creatine is not a steroid, it is totally different and works in a different manner. Pre workout supplements that contain creatine are not necessarily bad, they just won’t be as effective, since they don’t have a high enough dose. Which is better for you depends on what you need to reach your fitness goals. On the other hand, when you take creatine regularly, your body is able to use what it has already stored for future workouts.
