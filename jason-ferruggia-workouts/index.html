The friday workout is predominantly upper body based but does include some lower body work that doesn’t stress the knee or the spine. To kick of the workout you could start with some jumps or medicine ball throws to fire up the cns. There are typically no barbell lifts on this day; Just get about ten minutes of hard work in and keep each set under twenty seconds in duration.
