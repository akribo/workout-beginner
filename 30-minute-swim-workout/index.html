Three 30minute Swimming Workouts For Beginners David From blog.davidlloyd.co.uk
Before you start swimming for exercise, have a qualified coach look at your stroke to ensure proper technique, which prevents overuse injuries. You can build endurance and lose weight while giving your body the best workout it’s ever had in as little as 30 minutes a day. This style of training is perfect for those who want to compete in shorter events, such as the 100 freestyle, 50 freestyle, or 50 butterfly. While you swim count strokes per length and try to use less strokes on each length.
