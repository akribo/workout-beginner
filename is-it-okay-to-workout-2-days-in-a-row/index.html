Can I Drink Light Beer On Workout Days? From blacktailnyc.com
If i do need to train chest more than once per week it would be a full chest workout on monday, and light chest with tri�s and bi�s on friday. Your body thrives on variety, not speciality; If you dont go too heavy its ok, but if you are going to overlap a lot with heavy weight and many sets, try not to work out two days in a row. If you continue to train chest two days in a row, you will overtrain, and your muscles will not grow!

For example, strength training two days in a row wouldn�t be such a good idea as your muscles need time to recover and rebuild. This method of double stimulation prolongs muscle protein synthesis, leads to enhanced feedback in muscle, and triggers greater muscle responsiveness. Some people believe that you should train frequently, often two or more days in a row, to make the best gains, while others prefer a more conservative approach, resting for at least a day between sessions. You can train the same muscle group two days in a row.</p>
<p>It�s ok, but you may not be able to hit everything hard 2 days in a row. Many people avoid training the same muscle group two days in a row for fear of injury. If you dont go too heavy its ok, but if you are going to overlap a lot with heavy weight and many sets, try not to work out two days in a row. <em>In New Book, Two Brothers Exercise the Right to Get to</em>, If i do need to train chest more than once per week it would be a full chest workout on monday, and light chest with tri�s and bi�s on friday.</p>
