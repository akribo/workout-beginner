Surgery 6 Days PostOp YouTube From youtube.com
Patients may walk casually (not briskly) as soon as they feel comfortable after surgery. For the first 48 hours we recommend you take it easy and avoid any exercise or cardio. For a month following gynecomastia surgery, avoid workouts that exercise the area of your operation. After surgery, you’ll want to ease into working out again, and not push yourself too far, too soon.
