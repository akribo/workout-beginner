Flatout 4 Total Insanity, Strategy First, Xbox One From walmart.com
Whilst i’d played, and enjoyed one of its predecessors, i wasn’t sure what to make of this effort. For ages 17 and up, violence, blood and gore. Insanity is this progressive program that is really great in the way that it is laid out through out the week and then upping the intensity in the second month. Total insanity had exactly the same effect on me.
