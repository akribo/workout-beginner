Pink Ultimate Yoga Pants Pant So From pantso.com
Athleta makes popular and stylish workout leggings, and so does lululemon. Compared to leggings, yoga pants are more for the workout, especially yoga. Made from a soft cotton jersey knit with stretch for ease, the fabric on these leggings is substantial which means it minimizes the lumps and bumps you hate seeing in most other leggings. Skin tight yoga pants are made from a double fabric of polyester, elastane, spandex, leather or even cotton.
