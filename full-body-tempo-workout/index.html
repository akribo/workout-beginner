Yes, you can perform cardio during the rest days of a full body workout routine. The only things you need to remember while following this full body workout plan is be consistent with your workouts and rest days, follow a good diet plan, drink enough fluids. A full body workout routine is a strength training program built around training most or all of the entire body during each workout rather than splitting it up into different parts. Rest 30 seconds between rounds.
