I had my eyebrows microbladed 4 weeks ago and i kept aquafor (vaseline works too) i did coconut oil as well and left the cream or oil on it basically all day for nearly two weeks Instead, relax while your brows heal. Cleaned my brows with the provided stuff for the first 24 hours and applied a thin layer of ointment like advised. Do not use makeup, specifically on brows, it can fade pigment fast.
