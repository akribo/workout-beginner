A Nutritionist Explains What to Eat Before &#43; After From helloglow.co
A bar can even be a great pre bedtime snack if you�re hungry and have extra calories available to consume for the day. For most people, who train before lunch or after work your breakfast or lunch meal should cover your needs and you won’t need to take in additional protein before working out. The food we eat before exercising is there to provide us with enough energy and nutrients to get us through our reps, so it makes sense that protein before exercise might give us an extra boost. Protein plays an important role in repairing and rebuilding your muscles after exercise, and many people use protein shakes after their workouts to aid this process.
